Whether you are new to programming in general or just C++, you will encounter a range of new terms. 
This page tries to put a meaning to as many such terms as possible.

Class members that are not initialized in the initializer list are default initialized.  |

For example, assuming `i` and `j` are ints, then `i + j` is an expression and yields the sum of the two int values.   |

|operator| Symbol that determines what action an expression performs. The language defines a set of operators and what those operators mean when applied to values of built-in type. The language also defines the precedence and associativity of each operator and specifies how many operands each operator takes. Operators may be overloaded and applied to values of class type. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
|parameter list| Part of the definition of a function. Possibly empty list that specifies what arguments can be used to call the function.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
|result| Value or object obtained by evaluating an expression.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
|statement| A part of a program that specifies an action to take place when the program is executed. An expression followed by a semicolon is a statement; other kinds of statements include blocks and `if`, `for`, and `while` statements, all of which contain other statements within themselves. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
|std| Name of the namespace used by the standard library. `std::cout` indicates that we’re using the name cout defined in the std namespace. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
|undefined behaviour| The result of executing a program whose behavior is prescribed to be unpredictable, in the language specification to which the computer code adheres.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
|uninitialized variable| Variable that is not given an initial value. Variables of class type for which no initial value is specified are initialized as specified by the class definition. Variables of built-in type defined inside a function are uninitialized unless explicitly initialized. It is an error to try to use the value of an uninitialized variable. Uninitialized variables are a rich source of bugs. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
|variable| A named object.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
|vector| Standard library type that holds a collection of elements of a specified type.      |
